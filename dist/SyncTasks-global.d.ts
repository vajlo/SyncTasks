 * A very simple promise library that resolves all promises synchronously instead of
 * kicking them back to the main ticking thread.  This affirmatively rejects the A+
 * standard for promises, and is used for a combination of performance (wrapping
 * things back to the main thread is really slow) and because indexeddb loses
 * context for its calls if you send them around the event loop and transactions
 * automatically close.
